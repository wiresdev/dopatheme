# Dopatheme
The purpose of this theme is to maximize the amount of fun and dopamine received from programming. The same way games use "tasty" looking colors in order to give us dopamine as we play, Dopatheme is an attempt to gamify programming and give you dopamine as you code!

Dopatheme delivers a clean, modern Vscode experience with bright, satisfying colors.

**Enjoy!**
